# 🧭 File Management System (C++)

The **File Management System** is a console-based application built in **C++** that allows users to efficiently manage files and directories through a simple command-line interface. This project demonstrates the practical use of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** and **UNIX system calls** such as `opendir`, `readdir`, `chdir`, `stat`, and `chmod`. It serves as a foundational tool for understanding system-level programming concepts, file handling, and command execution logic in C++.

This program supports a variety of essential file operations such as creating, copying, moving, deleting, searching, and managing file permissions. It also provides detailed file information, including file size, type, permissions, and last modified time. The system’s design focuses on clarity, modularity, and reusability by encapsulating all functionalities within a single class, `FileManager`.

Through this project, users can interactively perform tasks similar to those in UNIX terminals but within a self-contained C++ environment. Each command is easy to use, allowing the program to serve as both an educational resource and a functional file utility.

## 🚀 Features
- List all files and directories in the current path.  
- Change working directory dynamically.  
- Create, copy, move, and delete files.  
- Search files recursively through subdirectories.  
- Modify file permissions using octal representation (e.g., `chmod file.txt 755`).  
- Display detailed file information such as size, type, and last modification date.  
- Interactive, continuous command-line interface for real-time file management.  

## ⚙️ Technology Stack
- **Language:** C++  
- **Paradigm:** Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)  
- **System Calls:** `opendir`, `readdir`, `chdir`, `stat`, `chmod`, `remove`, `rename`  
- **Platform:** Linux / macOS (adaptable to Windows)  

## 🧠 Learning Outcomes
This project enhances understanding of:
- File I/O operations and low-level system calls in C++.  
- Recursive directory traversal and data handling.  
- Implementing robust, modular, and reusable code through OOP principles.  
- Building terminal-based applications that mimic real OS functionality.
