# File-Explorer-Application
The File Management System is a console-based application built in C++ that allows users to efficiently manage files and directories through a simple command-line interface. This project demonstrates the practical use of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and UNIX system calls such as opendir, readdir, chdir, stat, and chmod.
